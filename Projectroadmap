Project Roadmap
Every project has a beginning, and this one started with a simple idea:
“What if people could check their symptoms before deciding whether to see a doctor?”

Here’s a look at what’s already been done with the Intelligent Disease Symptoms Checker (IDSC).

✅ What i have  Already Accomplished
 Here’s what’s already been completed:

🏷️ Came up with the project title — Settled with ntelligent Disease Symptoms Checker (IDSC)

📝 Wrote and submitted the project proposal on D2L — our foundation is set

📄 Created a detailed README file — so anyone can understand what this project is about

💻 Found and adapted working Python code to build my very first version of the disease checker

🧰 Added key packages like google and requests — laying the groundwork for possible future web features

And of course, the core of the project — symptom-based disease detection — is up and running. We started with a small list of illnesses and then grew it to include more real-life conditions people face.

We now support:

✅ Diarrhea

✅ Malaria

✅ COVID-19

✅ Dengue

✅ Chikungunya

✅ Typhoid (recently added)

✅ Influenza (Flu) (also added)

✅ Chickenpox (added)

✅ Pneumonia (added too!)

These additions make the tool more helpful and realistic for different users around the world.

🧹 Tidied up the code and added comments so it’s easier to read and work on

🗒️ Wrote clear commit messages to track progress in a meaningful way

🚧 What i am  Working on Now
I am  currently making things smoother and easier to use:

🛠️ Improving how users enter their symptoms (so they don’t get confused or stuck)

🧪 Testing the app to catch bugs and make sure it works as expected

🔄 Streamlining the way symptoms are shown and selected, so it feels faster and more intuitive
